# Overview

Quote Saver is a mobile app I built to familiarize myself with Mobile App Development using Android Studio and Kotlin. I learned the basics of Android Studio and plan to continue increasing my understanding of the mobile app development process.

The purpose of Quote Saver is to store quotes that are meaningful to you or you find enjoyable. It has built in functionalities that allow you to search for different quotes by word, source, and keywords that you have attached to the quotes. This allows the user to find quotes or sayings for specific situations with just a little effort.

# Future Work

* Searching by word will order search results by frequency of word appearance.
* Add a carousel on the dashboard that scrolls through recently added, edited, highest viewed.
* Add an individual quote view that displays the quote, source, date added, keywords, and number of times viewed.
* Implement a SQL database for storing quotes instead of using local storage.
